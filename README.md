## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ 
- npm, yarn, pnpm, or bun

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env.local` file in the root directory with the following variables:

```env
# API Configuration
NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL=http://localhost:3001
NEXT_PUBLIC_BASE_URL=http://localhost:3000
```

### Installation

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
# or
pnpm install
```

2. Run the development server:
```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

3. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

### API Endpoints

The app expects a backend API running on `NEXT_PUBLIC_API_URL` with the following endpoints:

#### Authentication
- `POST /accounts` - Register new user (returns success message)
- `POST /sessions` - Login (returns `access_token`)

#### Dashboard & Data (requires authentication)
- `GET /dashboard` - Dashboard data
- `GET /categories` - Categories list
- `POST /categories` - Create category
- `POST /transaction-account` - Create account
- `POST /transactions` - Create transaction
- `GET /transactions?month={month}&year={year}&type={type}&categoryId={categoryId}&accountId={accountId}` - List transactions with filters

### Authentication

The app uses JWT token-based authentication:

1. Login with email and password at `/login`
2. Token is stored in `localStorage` and cookies
3. All API requests include the token in the `Authorization` header
4. If token is invalid or expired, user is redirected to login
5. Protected routes are handled by Next.js middleware

To use the app:
1. Create an account at `http://localhost:3000/register` or
2. Login at `http://localhost:3000/login` with existing credentials
3. Access is granted to the dashboard

### Pages

- Form validation with real-time feedback
- Password strength validation
